Language model (LM) distillation is a trending area that aims to distil the knowledge resided in a large teacher LM to a small student one. While various methods have been proposed to push the distillation to its limits, it is still a pain distilling LMs when a large capacity gap is exhibited between the teacher and the student LMs. The pain is mainly resulted by the curse of capacity gap, which describes that a larger teacher LM cannot always lead to a better student LM than one distilled from a smaller teacher LM due to the affect of capacity gap increment. That is, there is likely an optimal point yielding the best student LM along the scaling course of the teacher LM. Even worse, the curse of capacity gap can be only partly yet not fully lifted as indicated in previous studies.

However, the tale is not ever one-sided. Although a larger teacher LM has better performance than a smaller teacher LM, it is much more resource-demanding especially in the context of recent large LMs (LLMs). Consequently, instead of sticking to lifting the curse, leaving the curse as is should be arguably fine. Even better, in this paper, we reveal that the optimal capacity gap is almost consistent across different student scales and architectures, fortunately turning the curse into the law of capacity gap. The law later guides us to distil a 3B student LM (termed MiniMA) from a 7B teacher LM (adapted LLaMA2-7B). MiniMA is demonstrated to yield a new compute-performance pareto frontier among existing 3B LMs on commonly used benchmarks, and its instruction-tuned version (termed MiniChat) outperforms a wide range of 3B competitors in GPT4 evaluation and could even compete with several 7B chat models.

## üï∞Ô∏è Updates

[2024/1/3] [MT-Bench-ZH](./mt_bench_zh) is released to serve as a Chinese counterpart of multi-turn instruction-following evaluaion (e.g., MT-Bench). MT-Bench-ZH is essentially translated from MT-Bench by GPT-4 and further checked by human. On the MT-Bench-ZH, MiniChat-2-3B surpasses Qwen-Chat-1.8B and approximates Qwen-Chat-7B. And it indicates MiniChat-2-3B has a better bilingual ability than others (e.g., Phi-2, StableLM-Zephyr-3B, etc.).

[2023/12/29] MiniMA-MoE is kicked off, aiming at upcycling MiniMA-2-3B to an MoE model. Following the [Pyramid-MoE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/deepspeed-advancing-moe-inference-and-training-to-power-next-generation-ai-scale/) design, MiniMA-MoE has the bottom 25% MLPs with 2 experts while the top 75% MLPs with 4 experts, reaching ~7B parameters in total. Top-1 gating is used to preserve 3B activated parameters per token. The progress would be updated in a biweekly schedule (totally 6 biweeks as estimated) and could be tracked in [Live](#-live). We later decide to name it as MiniMix to show our respect to Mixtral.

[2023/12/27] Performance results are added for potential references in [Performance](#-performance). Still room for improvement, bravo!

[2023/12/27] MiniMA-2-3B and MiniChat-2-3B are successfully landed. MiniMA-2-3B is continued from MiniMA-3B with a more diverse data sources in Chinese, and MiniChat-2-3B are finetuned and optimized on a range of instruction and preference data. MiniMA-2-3B together with MiniMA-3B and other arts completes the new compute-performance pareto frontier, and MiniChat-2-3B achieves a score of 6.23 on [MT-Bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard), surpassing Vicuna-7B and approximating LLaMA-2-Chat-7B.

[2023/11/27] MiniChat-1.5-3B (MiniChat-3B enhanced with NEFTune and DPO) achieves a win rate of 78.55 on AlpacaEval Leaderboard : ) Keep going! However, we have found a mistake in our MiniChat-3B submission. And the mistake should be [fixed](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval/pull/176). MiniChat-3B instead achieves a win rate of 48.82 and can surpass ChatGLM2 but not Davinci-003.

[2023/11/16] MiniChat-3B achieves a win rate of ~~76.94~~ 48.82 on [AlpacaEval Leaderboard](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/), ~~surpassing Vicuna-7B v1.3 and~~ leaving large room for improvement.

[2023/11/15] Wait, what!? MiniMA-2 is on the way! Just stay tuned ; ) The release is scheduled at the begining of year 2024 and hopefully it could be timely.

[2023/11/14] For models <= 3B on [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), MiniMA-3B surpasses ShearedLLaMA-2.7B and ranks #14, and MiniChat-3B (potentially with unidentified data contamination) surpasses Phi1.5 and ranks #2.

[2023/11/14] We have released the paper, uploaded the checkpoints, and updated the codebase.
